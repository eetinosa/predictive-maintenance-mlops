## Predictive Maintenance Application for Factory Equipment

## Project Overview

This repository contains all the resources and source code for our Predictive Maintenance Application designed to optimize maintenance activities in a factory setting. This application leverages historical maintenance data and will eventually integrate real-time IoT sensor data to predict potential equipment failures. The goal is to reduce downtime and maintenance costs while improving the longevity and reliability of factory equipment.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Data Dashboard**: Visualizes the health status of equipment.
- **Predictive Alerts System**: Sends notifications for upcoming maintenance needs.
- **Historical Data Analysis Interface**: Allows for deep dives into historical maintenance data.
- **Maintenance Scheduling Tool**: Assists in planning and optimizing maintenance operations.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitors the health and accuracy of deployed models.
- **User Management and Security**: Ensures data security through role-based access controls.
